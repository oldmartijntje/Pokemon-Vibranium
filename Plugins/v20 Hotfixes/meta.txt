#
# A "moves.txt" PBS file is also included with this plugin. It is the
# Gen 8 version of this file, with a few fixes compared to the one
# that came with Essentials v20:
#
# * Burning Jealousy now has the line:		EffectChance = 100
# * Jaw Lock now has the line:			EffectChance = 100
# * Beak Blast now has the line:		Priority = -3
#
# You should put this file in your PBS folder, or manually make the
# listed changes to your own copy of "moves.txt".
#
# Note that Beak Blast also appears in the Gen 7 version of this file,
# and will need to be amended manually if you use it. An updated
# version of it is NOT included with this plugin. There is only the
# one change to make.
